# Forum

## Synopsis

This project was created to adapt my previous project [json-placeholder](https://github.com/alinepickler/json-placeholder) to ReactJS. It uses the Fake Online REST API [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). It is a conceptual model of forum.

## Interface

The interface style is not applied yet. It's possible to visualize the interface prototype on my [Portfolio page](https://alinepickler.github.io/web.html#forum-row).

## Requirements

Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). Then execute the following in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```
Visit:  http://localhost:8080
